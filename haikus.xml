      Tumbling waves below,
      The cliff's edge looms dangerously,
      Courage fuels my step

      Few dare to brave the danger,
      But I am fearless

      As I reach the top,
      I feel a sense of oneness,
      With sky and heaven

      At the trail's start point,
      The horizon beckons me,
      A new adventure awaits

      Silent mountain top,
      Overwhelming awe and peace,
      All else fades away
